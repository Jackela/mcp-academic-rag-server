## 🎯 Refocusing Strategy

### Immediate Actions (Week 1)

1. **Remove Enterprise Features**
   - Disable Prometheus/Grafana monitoring
   - Remove Kubernetes manifests
   - Simplify Docker setup to single container
   - Remove enterprise security features

2. **Simplify Dependencies**
   - Remove Milvus → Use FAISS
   - Remove Redis → Use in-memory cache
   - Remove complex web frameworks
   - Keep only essential packages

3. **uvx Integration**
   - Update pyproject.toml for uvx compatibility
   - Create simple installation flow
   - Test with Claude Desktop integration

### Documentation Updates

1. **New README** - Focus on core MCP functionality
2. **Simplified Setup** - One-page installation guide
3. **Clear Scope** - Explicitly state what we DO and DON'T do
4. **User Expectations** - Set appropriate complexity expectations

---

## 🚨 Scope Creep Prevention

### Rules Going Forward

1. **Feature Addition Criteria**
   - Must directly support one of the 4 MCP tools
   - Must be essential for basic document processing
   - Must improve core user experience
   - Must NOT add enterprise complexity

2. **Automatic "No" Features**
   - Multi-tenant architecture
   - Enterprise monitoring/dashboards
   - Complex deployment orchestration
   - Advanced security frameworks
   - Complex UI frameworks

3. **Decision Framework**
   ```
   New Feature Request → Is it essential for basic MCP? 
   ├── Yes → Does it add <30% complexity?
   │   ├── Yes → Consider implementation
   │   └── No → Defer to future version
   └── No → Reject (scope creep)
   ```
