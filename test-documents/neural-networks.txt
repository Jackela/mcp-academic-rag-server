Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep networks) to model and understand complex patterns in data.

Architecture Components:
- Input Layer: Receives raw data inputs
- Hidden Layers: Process and transform data through weighted connections
- Output Layer: Produces final predictions or classifications
- Activation Functions: Non-linear functions like ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh
- Backpropagation: Algorithm for training networks by updating weights

Types of Neural Networks:
1. Feedforward Networks: Information flows in one direction
2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Excellent for image processing
3. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Handle sequential data
4. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Advanced RNNs for long sequences
5. Transformer Networks: State-of-the-art for natural language processing

Applications include computer vision, speech recognition, natural language understanding, recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles. Training requires large datasets and significant computational resources, often using GPUs or specialized hardware.

Deep learning has achieved breakthrough results in tasks previously thought to require human-level intelligence.
